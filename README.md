## Purpose

This app is a simple setup for a frontend app, running a Node Express server and rendering a React frontend.

## Use

Open two terminal windows. In one, run "npm start" from the root folder. This will start server.js on port 3005.

In the second, change directory to "client/" and run "npm start". This will start the App.js on port 3000.

There is a proxy defined in package.json of the client to avoid CORS issues.
